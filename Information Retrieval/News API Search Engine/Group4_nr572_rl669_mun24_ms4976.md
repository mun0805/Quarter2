## Topic: Search Engine Building

## Abstract

There is always a bunch of data available on the internet where we intend to find  information on any given topic. 
We tend to search up on the internet by using certain keywords, based on the key word the system checks the relevant 
information available in the internet and displays based on a specific criteria. Finding the relevant information when 
there is more information available is the most challenging approach to search and find what is needed. We are going to 
use this search criteria to design and construct an “Information Retrieval Search Engine” system for the news domain. 
Where we have identified the “News API” : “http://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=country&apiKey=401ee1a482544786bd3748fa276292ca” 
which will be acting as our data source and used in designing and constructing  our search engine. 
For Example : if we want to search for a specific word, let us consider “Covid” as a search word, we get to have many relevance 
with respect to each news channel covering for “Covid”, for instance considering “BBC” and “CNN” channel, both would have the 
similar news with the relevance. So, our goal in this regard is : “we are collecting upto date relevant news from different channels 
using the “News API” and storing it as “JSON” file in the “Elastic Server” where you search with a specific keyword, it shows 
the relevant “News Articles” related to the keyword from various channels. This will be done based on the ranking given to each of the 
“News Articles”, the scoring/ranking of the documents shall be in accordance with the keyword search in the specific document.
